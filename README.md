Student profile analyzer:
A simple, interactive tool that lets users upload a resume (PDF/DOCX) and instantly view its structured details (like name, contact info, education, experience, and skills) — all powered by NLP and presented in a sleek Gradio interface.
Why it matters:

Converts unstructured resume text into clean, machine-readable data (JSON or tables).

Gradio UI allows users to upload files and get real-time parsed output—no web development skills needed.

Serves as a foundation for building resume review tools, ATS systems, or smart career advice apps.
